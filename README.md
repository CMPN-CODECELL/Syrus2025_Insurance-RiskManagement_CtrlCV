# Project Update  

## Changes Implemented  

### 1. Proper Risk Score Formula  
- A new and accurate risk score calculation formula has been implemented.  
- The formula is included in the project presentation (PPT).  
- It enhances risk assessment and provides better results.  

### 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration  
- RAG has been created but is not yet fully integrated into the workflow.  
- **Challenge:** Handling large PDF reports for GPT processing.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Convert PDFs to images.  
  - Extract text from images using JavaScript.  
  - This reduces large PDFs into smaller text chunks, making it manageable for GPT.  

## Progress on Sub-Agents  
- All sub-agents and their intents are defined.  
- The workflow of two agents is completed.
